# Tic-Tac-Toe in Rust

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe repository! This project serves as an **educational tool** to learn programming concepts in Rust through building a simple yet progressively advanced game.

## Purpose
This repository is part of a tutorial series on the [CodeQuest Hub](https://codequesthub.io), where we:
- Explore core Rust concepts.
- Implement modular and testable code.
- Experiment with AI techniques, such as the **minimax algorithm**.

## Blog Series
